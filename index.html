I haven't had the skills to do so until now.</p> <div class="text-center"><div class="border-t border-gray-700 w-1/2 my-4"></div></div> <p class="svelte-1k8oigj">So take yourself back to 2020 and hearing the news you attended an event with someone who has since tested positive for COVID.</p> <p class="svelte-1k8oigj">Is your risk of catching COVID from that person low, medium or high?
